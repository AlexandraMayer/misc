# Find libyaml-cpp with API version 0.5
#
# Usage:
#   find_package(YamlCpp05 [REQUIRED] [QUIET])
#
# Sets the following variables:
#   - YAMLCPP_FOUND          .. true if library is found
#   - YAMLCPP_LIBRARIES      .. full path to library
#   - YAMLCPP_INCLUDE_DIR    .. full path to include directory
#
# Honors the following optional variables:
#   - YAMLCPP_INCLUDE_LOC    .. include directory path, to be searched before defaults
#   - YAMLCPP_LIBRARY_LOC    .. the library's directory path, to be searched before defaults
#   - YAMLCPP_STATIC_LIBRARY .. if true, find the static library version
